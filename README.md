# CleanDataProject

This repository contains a tidy dataset based on the dataset "Human Activity
Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0"

This dataset itself is called `mean_and_std_of_features_by_activity.txt`

A list of variable names is available in `features.txt`.

Both these files can be generated with `run_analysis.R`.

This R Script assumes the original data is available in the current directory
under the name `UCI HAR Dataset/`.

The steps taken to derive this dataset from the original dataset are
described in `CodeBook.md`.
